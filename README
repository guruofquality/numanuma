# NUMANUMA - A cross-platform NUMA API abstraction layer
########################################################################

Motivation:
NUMA (non-uniform memory architecture) is coming, be prepared!
I wrote this library to better understand the various NUMA APIs,
and to make a useful cross-platform abstraction layer.
This library aims to provide a cross platform access for

- node comprehension: query system CPU and memory groupings
- thread affinity: move threads to particular nodes
- thread scheduling: alter the priority of a thread
- memory allocation: allocate memory on a specific node

Requirements:
This library is implemented on top of libnuma and libpthread for linux,
and standard windows.h stuff when building in MSVC.
